# Monte Carlo Markov Chain Simulation of How Large Molecules are Transported Inside the Cells 

This is repository has the codes used to simulate how large molecules (roughly nm to um scale). We used the Gillespie algorithm to design stochastic MCMC model in kinetics. 

The study has been published in *Traffic* and has been selected as the Editor's Choice for April, 2019. 

[Load‐dependent detachment kinetics plays a key role in bidirectional cargo transport by kinesin and dynein](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tra.12639)

Key descoveries are 
1. Detachment kinetics play a higher role in how cargo is being trasported, rather than how strong (high stall force) or how fast (high forward stepping kinetics)
2. Yildiz's data of 1 kinesin-1 vs 1 DDB were successfully recapitulated and hence we propose a theoretical coarse-grain model of how the cargo is transported



## How to run

Run PaperCodes > OpticalTrap.m for single molecule run-velocity, run-length for kinesin-1, kinesin-2 and cytoplasmic dynein
Run PaperCodes > TugOfWar.m for multi-motor cargo transport in kinesin-1, kinesin-2 and cytoplasmic dynein
Run Animation > test_cargo.m for animation
